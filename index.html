                        To make a subject access request, you should send the request to the Company’s Director of Security
                        and Compliance by e-mail at <a target="_top"
                                                       href="mailto:contactibexdigital@ibex.co">contactibexdigital@ibex.co</a>. In some cases, the
                        Company may need to ask for proof of identification before the request can be processed. The Company
                        will inform you if it needs to verify your identity and the documents it requires. <br /><br />
                        The Company normally will respond to a request within a period of one month from the date it is
                        received. In some cases, such as where the Company processes large amounts of an individual's
                        personal data, it may respond within three months of the date the request is received. The Company
                        will write to you within one month of receiving the original request to tell you if this is the
                        case. <br /><br />
                        If an employee’s access request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, the Company is not required to
                        comply with it. Alternatively, the Company can agree to respond but will charge a fee, which will be
                        based on the administrative cost of responding to the request. A subject access request is likely to
                        be manifestly unfounded or excessive where it repeats a request to which the Company has already
                        responded. If an employee submits a request that is unfounded or excessive, the Company will notify
                        the employee that this is the case and whether or not it will respond to it.

                                thereafter transfer the personal information to third parties acting as controllers. A
                                “controller” is a person or organization which, alone or jointly with others, determines the
                                purposes and means of the processing of personal information. Examples of third party
                                controllers may include banks and healthcare providers, or management personnel in other
                                Company offices outside of the U.S. When the Company makes such onward transfers to third

                                provide the same level of protection for the personal information as required by the Privacy
                                Shield principles; and (4) upon such notice by the third party controller, the third party
                                controller will cease processing the personal information and/or take reasonable and
                                appropriate steps to remediate any unauthorized processing.
